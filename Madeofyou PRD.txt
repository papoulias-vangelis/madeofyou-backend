3. Core Functional Requirements (User Stories)
Epic 1: Resource Discovery & Lead Generation (Highest Priority)
Story ID
	User Story
	Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	FR.1
	As a parent, I can filter Resources by Age Range, Category, and Tags on the listing page so I can quickly find relevant free content.
	The /resources listing page displays active filters for Age Range, Category, and Tags. Filtering is fast (Client-Side) and built from the initial SSG payload.
	FR.2 (Instant)
	As a parent accessing a Simple Resource (is_gated: FALSE), clicking the CTA button immediately downloads the PDF file.
	The CTA button uses the text from cta_text and links directly to the instant_pdf URL, triggering a browser download.
	FR.3 (Gated)
	As a parent accessing a Premium Resource Pack (is_gated: TRUE), clicking the CTA button opens a modal with an email capture form.
	The modal form submits the email data securely to a Next.js API route proxy, which forwards it to the external email provider (lead_form_id).
	FR.4
	As a parent, after submitting my email for a Premium Pack, I am redirected to the download fulfillment page.
	The fulfillment page provides the direct download link for the gated_pdf content.
	Epic 2: Product Shopping & Referral
Story ID
	User Story
	Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	FR.5
	As a parent, I can filter Products by Type (Physical/Digital), Age Range, and Tags (e.g., AR books, hardcopy).
	The /products listing page provides active client-side filters for Product Type, Age Range, and Tags.
	FR.6
	As a parent, when viewing a product, I can see a Buy Now button which either links externally (Amazon) or embeds the Shopify checkout widget.
	The button action is determined by the link field: Amazon/Other opens a new tab; Shopify embeds the widget. No internal cart.
	Epic 3: SEO and Metadata (New)
Story ID
	User Story
	Acceptance Criteria (AC)
	SE.1
	As a content editor, I can define custom SEO/Open Graph (OG) metadata for every page.
	The reusable seo_metadata block is available on all content schemas (Post, Product, Resource, Page).
	SE.2
	As a system, every page must correctly render standard SEO and OG tags in the <head> element.
	All SSG pages must dynamically render <title>, <meta name="description">, og:title, og:image, etc., using the custom data or intelligent fallbacks.

4. Technology Stack and Architecture
A. Technology Stack
Area
	Technology
	Purpose
	Frontend
	Next.js (App Router)
	Performance, Routing, and SSG.
	CMS
	Sanity.io
	Headless CMS and content API via GROQ.
	Styling/UI
	Tailwind CSS & Shadcn/ui
	Rapid, accessible, utility-first UI development.
	E-commerce
	Shopify (Buy Button/Widget)
	Externalized, embedded checkout.
	B. Architectural Strategy (Optimized for SEO)
* Rendering Method: Static Site Generation (SSG) for all public content pages (Post, Product, Resource, Listing). This guarantees that Google can crawl the full, rendered HTML instantly.
* Data Fetching: All content is fetched from Sanity via GROQ during the build process (next build). There are no runtime API content calls for SEO-critical pages.
* Filtering: Filters are rendered via SSG on initial load, and the dynamic filtering logic is handled Client-Side (CSR) using the static JSON data payload for maximum speed.
* Security: Next.js API Routes (Serverless Functions) will be used as a secure proxy to receive and forward lead-capture data to the external email provider, preventing the exposure of private API keys.

	The site is purely a referral portal; transactions are handled by external services.
	User Management

	No personalized content is stored.
	Search
	Full-text site-wide search functionality.
	Content discovery relies solely on Category, Tag, and Age Range filtering.
